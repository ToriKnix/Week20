      <p>My name is Blaine Duran and being on this journey to becoming a developer has been amazing!
        So far I have learned so much such as how to build sites from scratch, interact with APIs, create servers and apps
        and more! I am hoping to be able to use these skills to provide a way better life for 
        my family. That is definitely the dream come true.
